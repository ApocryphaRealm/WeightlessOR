## Apocrypha Menu Framework consumer header (`include/AMF.h`) - MIT

The framework's one-header API, vendored as-is; it resolves the framework's exports at runtime, so the plugin runs
without the framework installed (the INI still applies).

## TestBench consumer API (`include/TestBenchAPI.h`) - MIT

The small header the plugin uses to register its test tool with TestBench, a separate, optional, private testing
plugin. The plugin only talks to it through that interface, and runs the same without it.
